# Impact of Technology website

**Ignore the server side folder** which contains file for an api which would validate the account infomation which is connected to a mongoDB data-base.

As I used react instead of normal javascript I uploaded the website to "https://wqe220993webproject.netlify.app/".
In the index.html file, when opened it will re-direct the user to the online netlify site as i couldn't package the react files to normal html/css/js files.

**Index.html file: ** "https://github.com/22102913/Impact_of_Technology_website_/blob/master/index.html".
