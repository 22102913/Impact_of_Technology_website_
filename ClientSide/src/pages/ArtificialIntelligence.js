                Artificial Intelligence (AI) presents both potential dangers and significant benefits to society. On one hand, there are concerns about the ethical implications and risks associated with the development and use of AI technologies. These include issues such as privacy invasion, job displacement, algorithmic biases, and the potential for autonomous systems to make incorrect or biased decisions without human oversight.
